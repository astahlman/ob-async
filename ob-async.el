;;; Commentary:
;; This file enables asynchronous execution of org-babel
;; src blocks through the ob-async-org-babel-execute-src-block function

;;; Code:

(provide 'ob-async)

(require 'org)
(require 'async)
(require 'dash)

(defvar ob-async-no-async-languages-alist nil
  "async is not used for languages listed here. Enables
compatibility for other languages, e.g. ipython, for which async
functionality may be implemented separately.")

(defvar ob-async-pre-execute-src-block-hook nil
  "Hook run in the async child process prior to executing a src
block. You can use this hook to perform language-specific
initialization which would normally execute in your init file.")

  "Like org-babel-execute-src-block, but run asynchronously.

Original docstring for org-babel-execute-src-block:

Execute the current source code block.  Insert the results of
execution into the buffer.  Source code execution and the
collection and formatting of results can be controlled through a
variety of header arguments.

With prefix argument ARG, force re-execution even if an existing
result cached in the buffer would otherwise have been returned.

Optionally supply a value for INFO in the form returned by
`org-babel-get-src-block-info'.

Optionally supply a value for PARAMS which will be merged with
the header arguments specified at the front of the source code
block."
