#+TITLE: Issue Reporting Checklist
#+PROPERTIES: :header-args :results value

This checklist will help you diagnose problems with your =ob-async=
setup.

* Instructions

Execute the src blocks one at a time with =ctrl-c ctrl-c= to
ensure that =ob-async-org-babel-execute-src-block= is used for files
with the :async header-arg. If by the end of this file your issue
isn't solved, open an issue on Github with the contents of this file.

First, make sure you can execute emacs-lisp src blocks *without* the
async header argument. Otherwise you've got bigger problems, and none
of this is going to work.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(message "Yes, I can synchronously execute emacs-lisp from an org-babel src block.")
#+END_SRC

* Checklist

From where are you loading =ob-async=?

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(symbol-file 'ob-async-org-babel-execute-src-block)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(message "PID: %s\nEmacs version: %s\norg version: %s\nPath to org: %s" (emacs-pid) (emacs-version) (org-version) (symbol-file 'org-version))
#+END_SRC

Execution of the :async block occurs in an Emacs subprocess. Are you
using a consistent version of emacs and org-mode across both
processes? Compare the output of this block the output of the previous block.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :async
(message "PID: %s\nEmacs version: %s\norg version: %s\nPath to org: %s" (emacs-pid) (emacs-version) (org-version) (symbol-file 'org-version))
#+END_SRC

The Emacs subprocess inherits the value of =org-babel-load-languages=
from its parent. Here are the languages which are loaded in the
subprocess. If you don't see your desired language here, it means you
never added it to =org-babel-load-languages= (in the parent process).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :async
org-babel-load-languages
#+END_SRC

If you're still facing problems, turn on async debugging.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq async-debug t)
#+END_SRC

If possible, replace the following block with a block that reproduces
your problem, then execute it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :async
(message "I'm executed in a subprocess.")
#+END_SRC

This is the elisp that was sent to the Emacs subprocess. If there's
still nothing obviously wrong, file an issue on GitHub and include the
contents of this file as a Gist.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (switch-to-buffer "*Messages*")
  (goto-char (point-max))
  (re-search-backward "Transmitting sexp {{{\\([^}]+\\)}}}")
  (match-string 1)
#+END_SRC
