`ob-async` enables asynchronous execution of org-babel src blocks,
like this:

![Demo of async sh execution](readme-demo.gif)

`ob-async` isn't tied to src blocks in a specific org-babel
language. Simply add the keyword `:async` to the header-args of any
org-babel src block and invoke `ob-async-org-babel-execute-src-block`.

## Installation

`ob-async` is available in MELPA. If you'd rather install from source,
make sure `ob-async.el` is on your `load-path`, like this.

    (add-to-list 'load-path "$PATH_TO_OB_ASYNC_ROOT_DIR")

Require the package and `ob-async` will handle any source block which
includes `:async` in its header-args.

    (require 'ob-async)

## Development

[Cask](https://github.com/cask/cask) manages dependencies and runs
tests. Once Cask is installed, you can `make test`.

## Troubleshooting

First, go through the troubleshooting checklist,
`troubleshooting.org`. It's an org-mode file in this repository that's
designed to diagnose issues with ob-async. If that doesn't solve your
problem, include a copy of the entire file (which will include your
`#+RESULTS` blocks) in a Github issue.
